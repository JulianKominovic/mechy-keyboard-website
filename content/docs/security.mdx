## Key listening

Mechy Keyboard listens to your keyboard input to provide the features you need.
We don't store your keystrokes for more than a few seconds. This is necessary to coordinate the sounds as you type.

Here you have a chart of the data flow:

Go ahead and click on the image to see it in full size. [Download to tldraw file if you want](/keypresses-logic.tldr)

I hope this clarifies how we handle your keypresses.

[Here is the line of code that does it](https://github.com/JulianKominovic/mechy-keyboard/blob/master/src-tauri/src/main.rs#L69). I cannot promise that these lines of code will always be the same, but you can always check the source code of the app to clear any doubts you may have: [https://github.com/JulianKominovic/mechy-keyboard](https://github.com/JulianKominovic/mechy-keyboard)
